Join MapPH and Project NOAH's #geoweekmnl meetup on November 18 from 10am to 3pm at the University of the Philippines National 
Institute of Geological Sciences Room 301. Snacks and lunch will be served. To celebrate National Geography Week, learn how to 
map on OpenStreetMap, write Wikipedia entries, use Project NOAH's weather and disaster risk apps, and report public and private 
sector needs on MapPH.com. We hope to visualize community needs to local and international donors for the upcoming holiday season. 
This event is free! Everyone is welcome.
