Come and join us the November for an afternoon of humanitarian mapping and free food. No previous experience required.

On Wednesday 15th November we will be hosting a Missing Maps event in support of Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), the Red Cross and the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT), to help improve maps of vulnerable or disaster affected places.

This event also sees us joining mapathons all around the world for OSM Geo Week and GIS Day!

The event is being held in IT suite Room 01/110, Medical Biology Centre at Queens University Belfast between 4.30-6.30pm.
