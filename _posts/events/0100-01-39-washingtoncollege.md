Come join the Washington College GIS Program and METS Guild students during our community mapathon event sponsored by Verizon! We’re on a   mission to help the Humanitarian Open Street Map Team (HOT) in mapping the world’s most vulnerable places so that local and international organizations can better respond in times of crisis—such as hurricanes, earthquakes, and wildfires.
