The University of Chicago's library, Research Computing Center, Humanities Computing, and UChicagoGRAD are partnering to host two map-a-thon sessions open to all current UChicago students, faculty, staff, and affiliates. 

Join us Thursday, November 16 from 11:30 a.m.-1:30 p.m. or 4:00-6:00 p.m. Both events will be held in BSLC 016. Twenty computers are available for use, but participants may also bring their own laptops to ensure participation.
