The MissingMaps event will be organized in collaboration with another one of the partner organizations of the MissingMaps project, 
the French based NGO CartONG. CartONG is currently conducting Mapping projects in Madagascar in cooperation with MissingMaps.
We would like to support these efforts with our Mapping Event!

We will as usual provide snacks, drinks and nice after work sound!

We are looking forward to a large crowd, no previous knowledge needed. Just bring your laptop and mouse if available!
