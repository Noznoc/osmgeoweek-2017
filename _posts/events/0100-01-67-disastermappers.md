disastermappers heidelberg/GIScience Research Group invite to a special Missing Maps event in scope of this year`s OSM Geoweek! The event will start with an overview of the OSM Geoweek, afterwards we will provide a short introduction into remote mapping in OpenStreetMap before the mapping sessions begin. We will as usual provide snacks, drinks and nice after work sound. We are looking forward to a large crowd, no previous knowledge needed. Just bring your laptop and mouse if available!
