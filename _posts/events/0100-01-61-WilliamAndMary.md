Come join us for an evening of mapping to support a global cause to combat HIV/AIDs, with free pizza and rad tunes included! No experience necessary--we will have expert mappers on site to help teach all the skills you need! The event is sponsored by the US State Departmentâ€™s MapGive Program and the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) to support data-driven initiatives combating HIV/AIDS. We will create maps in a PEPFAR region on OpenStreetMap to be used by local health workers to find health clinics and connect patients with resources.
