Whether you are new to geography or a GIS expert, come to the Davis Library Research Hub (location?) and contribute to the largest existing open source map of the world. Contrary to popular belief, large parts of the world have yet to be mapped. The Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team aims to fill in the blanks where it’s most needed, when it’s most needed. We’ll be combining our efforts to produce geospatial data for areas in crisis where relief workers, planners, governments, and locals need high-quality data to get their communities up and running again.  
Please join our GIS Day Humanitarian Mapathon from 2:00-3:30 on Nov 15, 2017. Bring a laptop computer and we’ll start contributing shortly after a quick demonstration.
