As part of Open Street Map Geography Awareness Week, Nov 12-18, 2017, the International Services department will be hosting a Missing Maps Mapathon. During this Mapathon we will be mapping areas of Somalia. Somalia is a war torn country that faces armed conflict, drought, food insecurities, health crises, and is home to thousands of internally displaced persons. By mapping Somalia you can assist aid workers with delivering critical aid, as well as, help local community member’s access to services they may not be aware of.
