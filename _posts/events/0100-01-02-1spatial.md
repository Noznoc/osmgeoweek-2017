Join us this November for an evening of humanitarian mapping (and food!). No previous experience required.

On Wednesday 15th November from 6pm-8:30pm, we will be hosting a Missing Maps event in support of Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), the Red Cross and the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT), to help improve maps of vulnerable or disaster affected places.
