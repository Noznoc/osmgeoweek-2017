A Mapathon is where people from all backgrounds work together to add data to maps in areas in need. Mapping with OpenStreetMap is a great way to contribute to international humanitarian aid without leaving your room! We map anywhere in the world, but we give priority to areas in need of disaster relief (like Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria). All you need is a laptop and internet connection! OpenStreetMap is an online tool, so no software is necessary. OSM is easy to learn, no mapping experience is required! Please bring your laptop to the Mapathon. Any laptop will do! Food and drink will be served and you are welcome to come anytime between 6-9pm. The work is individual (though helping each other is encouraged!) so you will not miss anything if you show up halfway through. There will be a brief overview at the start but there will be help throughout the event.
