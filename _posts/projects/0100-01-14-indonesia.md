These projects are for the development of OSM databases for the cities/regions of Surabaya containing building footprints, street centerlines, and key attributes, and “lifeline” infrastructures (e.g. police and fire stations, hospitals and medical facilities, schools, mosques, et cetera) for use within InAWARE, CogniCity, and InaSAFE for disaster preparedness, reporting, and response by Government of Indonesia (GoI) disaster managers at national and local levels.
