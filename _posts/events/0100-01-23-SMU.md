Missing Maps Mapathon - Come and Go!
Join the Humanitarian Relief Effort!
Volunteer an hour or two of your time to help create maps for disaster response activities. It's as easy as bringing your laptop to the Fondren Library Collaborative Commons (near Starbucks) and tracing satellite images. A limited number of laptops will be available to check out. No experience is necessary!
