This year for GIS Day, use your geospatial skill to help people in vulnerable regions at this humanitarian mapathon! Emily Eros, GIS Team Lead for the Red Cross, will be coming up from Bend to lead the group, and we have booked a room at PSU with 20 computers and space for 15 laptops. Itâ€™s a great chance to do some good, learn about OSM, and meet a few like-minded mappers. If you can, please also join us for the GIS Day evening social at Ecotrust at 6pm.
