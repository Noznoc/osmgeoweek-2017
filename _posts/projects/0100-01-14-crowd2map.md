[Crowd2Map Tanzania](https://crowd2map.wordpress.com/) is a crowdsourced mapping project aiming to put rural Tanzania on the map. Since 2015, we have been adding schools, hospitals, roads, buildings and villages to OpenStreetMap with the help of over 2000 volunteers worldwide and 200 on the ground in Tanzania.  We have so far added over a 1.8 million buildings and mapped over 70,000 sq kilometres starting with the areas where girls are at risk of FGM (Female Genital Mutilation) so that activists can better protect them. We were recently awarded a microgrant by Humanitarian OpenStreetMap to train community mappers in [8 areas of Tanzania](http://www.fragosus.pe.hu/Janet/dashboard.htm), and presented a [community webinar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQb3kmByjlI&feature=youtu.be) for them.  We have also been featured on [Al Jazeera](https://www.facebook.com/ajplusenglish/videos/873491619459013/), [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/feb/06/online-mapping-tool-gives-fgm-runaways-a-path-to-help?CMP=twt_a-world_b-gdnworld) and [Missing Maps](http://www.missingmaps.org/blog/2017/02/20/fighting-fgm-in-tanzania/).  We have also set up a Youthmappers Chapter at the Institute of Rural Development and Planning in Mwanza and Dodoma.  There is an update of our [project here](https://www.hotosm.org/updates/2017-08-02_crowd2map_tanzania_putting_rural_tanzania_on_the_map_with_the_help_of_a_hot).
